### What is PoopBotCode
Poop Bot Code is the github repo for the discord bot, Poop Bot. You **ARE** free to run the bot **AS LONG AS** you do **NOT** distribute it.
You **MUST** rename the bot, if a normal person would believe it is poop bot, then you are **NOT** free to run it.

### Why did I do this
three main reasons
- So new bot developers can \*reference my code
- I can clone to my server easier
- People can help me cause I suck
\* = Reference means look or use short bits of code, around 100 lines. If you're unsure join the support discord and DM me

### How to run the bot
Poop Bot isn't built to run on anything but my server, but I'll give you a small overview
